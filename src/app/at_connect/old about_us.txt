                                <p>
                                    ATConnect is Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology's first-ever fair connecting
                                    students and companies across the county to create and share their assistive technology with students
                                    with disabilities. The event is organized by TJ's Assistive Technology Club, which emphasizes working
                                    with and creating technology for students with disabilities. At the event, students and companies will
                                    present their products in separate booths for anyone to join.
